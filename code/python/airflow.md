# Airflow

## Guidelines

- By using *DockerOperators*/*KubernetesOperators* only we can avoid the technical debt that would existing by using different operators, and the dependency on Airflow development of operators([more on this](https://medium.com/bluecore-engineering/were-all-using-airflow-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it-a56f14cb0753)).

## How-to

### Setup a cluster

#### Pre-Requisites

- The following nodes are available with the given host names:

  - master1: Will have the role(s): Web Server, Scheduler
  - master2: Will have the role(s): Web Server
  - worker1: Will have the role(s): Worker
  - worker2: Will have the role(s): Worker

- A Queuing Service is Running. (RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, etc)

  - You can install RabbitMQ by following these instructions: 

    Installing RabbitMQ

    - If youâ€™re using RabbitMQ, it is recommended that it is also setup to be a cluster for High Availability. Setup a Load Balancer to proxy requests to the RabbitMQ instances.

## Comments

- Scale workers vertically by providing higher values to `celeryd_concurrency`
