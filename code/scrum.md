## Events
- Sprint(a time-box, max one month, during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created):
    - No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
    - Quality goals do not decrease; and,
    - Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.
    - A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete (Uncommon and traumatic).
    - Main concerns:
        - What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
        - How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
    - Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint (from the backlog).
    - Sprint Goal should be discussed by the scrum team.
    - Work should be decompose to units of one day or less.

- Daily (15minutes) Responsible Scrum Master:
    - Plans next 24hr work.
    - Track progress.
    - Guide:
        - What did i do yesterday towards the sprint goal.
        - What will i do today towards the sprint goal.
        - Any impediments towards sprint goal.
- Sprint review (max 4hr results in a reviewed product backlog) Responsible Scrum Master:
    - Detail what is done 
    - What is not
    - Detail insights, problems and solutions.
    - Check the increment
    - Most valuable thing to do next
    - Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product.
- Sprint retrospective
    - Improve work processes
    - Adapt "Done" definition


## Artifacts
- Product backlog (Product Owner):
    - Ordered list of every needed item in the product
    - Each item:
        - Description
        - Order (Higher the sooner is going to be done)
        - Estimate (By the people that is going to perform the work)
        - Value (Sum up sprint values for track performance)
        - Test descriptions
- Sprint backlog:
    - What is going to be done in the sprint.
    - It includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting.
    - As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog.
