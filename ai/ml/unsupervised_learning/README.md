# Unsupervised learning

## Clustering

### Data Dimensionality

One thing to note is that itâ€™s often easiest to form clusters when you have low-dimensional data. For example, it can be difficult, and often noisy, to get good clusters from data that has over 100 features. In high-dimensional cases, there is often a dimensionality reduction step that takes place *before* data is analyzed by a clustering algorithm.
