# On organizing knowledge

## Ideas

**Recommended sections for indexing knowledge on papers**

- Abstract
- Keywords
- Required terms
- Problem setting
- Details
- Experiments
  - Experiments from the subject authors or the community
    - Configurations
    - Results
 - Experiments from personal tests
   - Configurations
   - Results
- Related work/subjects
- Implementation reference
- Most relevant/Top references



### What to do with information based on different criteria

I've been collecting a few techniques on knowledge indexing but it seems necessary to document when to use them.

**Available techniques (curated)**

- A) [Cornell note taking system](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/) + [spaced repetition](https://fs.blog/2018/12/spacing-effect/); for remembering better
- B) Document things on this wiki; for practical knowledge, code or factual information.
- C) Feed into read later apps: For things that need to be processed.
- D) Practical recall + spaced repetition; for code usage and learning.



#### By change of the information over time

This criteria categorize knowledge depending on how quick the information is prone to change

**Low**

This type of information is useful to be stored because it's going to be useful for long time

> **Usage**: Document it based on format based criterion. 

**Med**

This type of information is known to change in midterm

> **Usage**: Probably decompose in Low change form and discard the rest.

**Quick**

This type of information is most likely to be tight to events that produce information with high probability of change or short lived.

> **Usage:** Don't even read it! Probably reconsider the value of the source that produced it.

**Unknown**

This type of information is based on premises that may or may not be prone to change over time.

> **Usage:** Try to decompose the piece in more canon parts that can be better assessed and use it as its new type.



#### By scope of usage (and format)

**Theory**

Self-explanatory

> **Usage:** Store specific questions of interest to A) and store canon factual bits in B)

**Practice**

Self-explanatory

> **Usage**: Save reusable bits to B) and if it's really important D)



#### By its relationship with subjects

**Factual**

True statements about subjects.

> **Usage**: Save the most useful level of it to B) and if the information involves complex relationships use A) as well

**Analytical**

Analysis made over factual information by subject expert

> **Usage:** ID based factual, Try to find counterexamples and when the proper analysis is settled treat as the canon factual parts, reflect on the analysis.
