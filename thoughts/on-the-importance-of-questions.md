# On the importance of questions

### Plato's dialogue

> A: I have all the answers.
>
> B: I want to test that.
>
> C: Ask me instead, A might be tired of answering my questions.
>
> B: Do you think you are as capable as A?
>
> C: What does it matter? All that matters is that my answers are good enough for you...

#### Reflection

To me this reflect a paradox, in that at the end the question is epistemica-lly more important than the answer and second, that the perception of the answer could be less than the answer offer which means that for more knowledge someone have about a topic our ROI from a question would be as high as we are able to think of, and even if the oracle of the topic provide an answer it might not be enough for us to our ends.
