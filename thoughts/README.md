### About money

"James Altucher has calculated the average millionaire has seven sources of income. I can see how that might make sense for the average successful business owner. Off of my head, here are seven sources of income she might have:

Earned income \(salary\) Profit income \(business profit\) Rental income \(real estate\) Royalty/patents income \(depending on your business\) Capital gains income \(if you sell an asset for more than you bought it for\) Dividend \(4% every year on average in index funds\) Interest \(lending money to someone else\)"

"On average, millionaires spend significantly more hours per month studying and planning their future investment decisions, as well as managing their current investments, than high-income nonmillionaires."

"Rule \#3: Know that financial independence is more important than displaying status"

"One thing Thomas noticed is that a lot of millionaires live on something like 10% of their income."

### About blogging

"Shane Snow himself used this tactic to get published on some of the biggest media outlets in the world within six months of blogging. How did he do it? He started by pitching articles to low level blogs with basically no bar of entry. After getting a few articles published on those, he leveraged his new position and pitched to slightly higher level blogs.

He did this by sending editors of the slightly “better” blogs an email reading something like: Hello, I’ve written at these blogs which reach similar audiences as your blog. Here’s an article I think would be a great fit for your audience.

Because the editors of those blogs knew about the blogs Snow had been published on, he was able to be published on theirs’ as well. He followed this pattern over and over until, within six months, his work was published at Fast Company, WIRED, and others."

### About money

"Money, from most people’s perspective, is a limited resource. However, research has found that after basic needs are met, what people really want is a state of mind. Yet, that state of mind doesn’t have to be tightly bound within the cognitive category of money."

"Identify your big-ticket expenses and cut them back."

### About time

"Let go of your beliefs about fixed-limits of time. Time is a unique concept, which few of us understand. It need not be linear nor lead to entropy. Again, many scholars are seeing that these are nothing more than assumptions, or fixed-mindsets about how things work."

### About desires

"As Ellen Langer, Harvard psychologist has said, “If we examine what is behind our desires, we can usually get what we want without compromising.”"

### Mix

"“When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.”"

"Quantity is the most likely path to quality. The more you produce, the more ideas you will have — some of which will be innovative and original. And you never know which ones will click. You just keep creating."

"“What does following in the footsteps of everyone else get you? It gets you to exactly the same conclusions as everyone else.” — Ryan Holiday"

"According to what psychologists call “The Pygmalion Effect,” other people’s expectations of you heavily influences how well you do."

"“When the student is ready the teacher will appear. When the student is truly ready, the teacher will disappear.” — Lao Tzu"

### About change

"“You will never change your life until you change something you do daily”— Mike Murdock"

"just focus on getting 1% better in whatever it is you’re trying to improve. That’s it. Just 1%."

### About wealth

"I learned first-hand that once our basic needs are taken care of, the level of contentment and happiness we experience has nothing to do with how much wealth we have."

"I now never help people who don’t ask me for help, and even then I only help them to the extent that they ask."

"The trick is to figure out how much money you actually need and want in order to get your pragmatic needs met. How much money do you need to live a reasonable lifestyle? Optionally, you could also work out how much wealth you need to accumulate in order to become financially independent while living your chosen lifestyle."

"The problem is that, as the U2 lyric goes, “You can never get enough of what you don’t really need.”"

"It turns out that having the discipline to live frugally, to invest rather than spend, to mend and make do, and to be able to live for longer and longer periods of time without having to work, are true measures of wealth. Deeply enjoying whatever it is you’re experiencing right now is the ultimate wealth."

"I know many people with extremely high net worths. Many of these people spend their time in pajamas, or flip-flops, or shorts. You can’t tell how wealthy someone is by what they’re wearing. You also can’t tell how wealthy someone is by how much money they have."
