### About on-boarding

Managers were more likely to provide new employees with helpful information when employees actively sought out information about their role and worked at making connections with new colleagues. Those who asked for and got help from their managers were more likely to succeed. The potential downside is that managers may fail to support new employees whom they perceive as being less committed, which may or may not be an accurate assessment.



## General

- _Why do we work 8–9 hours a day so that we can earn free time, while we endlessly waste that hard-earned free time?_
- focus on growth not status.
